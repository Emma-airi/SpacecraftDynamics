# # Rigid Body Kinematics
# Kinematics or Rigid body kinematics is the study of motion while ignoring the cause of motion. In kinematics, we are interested in "position", "velocity", and â€œacceleration" and the relationship between them. Therefor, in a physical sense, we are interested in describing the motion of $B$ in $A$ (see {numref}`rigid_body_intro`).
#

# Motion of a body $B$ relative to frame $A$.
# ```
# 
# ## Classification of Rigid Body Motion
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/14.png
# ---
# name: 14
# ---
# ```
# Broadly, there are two classifications for rigid body motion:
# - __Translation__: the motion of $B$ in $A$ is a translation if and only if any straight line segment embedded in $B$ remains parallel to itself when observed from $A$ when $B$ moves in $A$. If this condition is not met, then we have to consider the motion as rotation.
# 
# - __Simple rotation__: the motion of $B$ in $A$ is a simple rotation if and only if there exists a unit vector $\hat{\bf n}$ that remains fixed in both $B$ and $A$, as $B$ moves in $A$. Examples in figures below:
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/15.png
# ---
# name: 15
# ---
# (i) Disk (D) is in simple rotation with respect to the ground (A).
# (ii) Shaft (B) is in simple rotation with respect to a fixed axis (A).
# ```
# 
# Coming back to our old example of a door hinged to a wall.
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/16.png
# ---
# name: 16
# ---
# ```
# 
# Here, $\hat{\bf b}_y$ is a unit vector that is fixed in both $B$ and $A$. Using our definition for simple rotation tells us that $\hat{\bf b}_y$ is $\hat{\bf n}$. So, in mathematical notation, we can say:
# <!--
# ```{figure} ./images/17.png
# ---
# name: 17
# ---
# ```-->
# 
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb1
# \hat{\bf n} = \hat{\bf b}_y
# ```
# 
# But we must now pause to ask ourselves if there is any other unit vector that is also fixed in both $B$ and $A$? It turns out that there is, indeed, another one fixed in both $B$ and $A$: $\hat{\bf a}_y$. So, we can now also write:
# 
# <!--
# ```{figure} ./images/18.png
# ---
# name: 18
# ---
# ```-->
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb2
# \hat{\bf n} = \hat{\bf a}_y
# ```
# Consequently, from Equations {eq}`eqnrb1` and {eq}`eqnrb2`, we get:
# <!--
# ```{figure} ./images/19.png
# ---
# name: 19
# ---
# ```
# -->
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb3
# \hat{\bf b}_y = \hat{\bf a}_y
# ```
# 
# :::{admonition} Why is establishing Equation {eq}`eqnrb3` useful and critical?
# :class: tip, dropdown
# So far, we have written the vectors ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf e}$, in terms of the $B$ frame. As a result, they were not functions of $\theta$.
# 
# Expressing the vectors in the unit vectors attached to the A frame requires us to derive relationships between $\hat{\bf a}_i$ and  $\hat{\bf b}_i$, where $(i = x,y,z)$.
# 
# Equation {eq}`eqnrb3` allows us to derive a relationship between $\hat{\bf a}_i$ and $\hat{\bf b}_i$, which then provides a basis for developing the rigid body kinematics.
# :::
# 
# Let us explore how to derive these relationships for the vectors ${\bf e}$ and ${\bf v}$ in the doorwall example (figure is shown again below):
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/16.png
# ---
# name: 16
# ---
# ```
# 
# From the second of Equations in {eq}`eqn1`, we have:
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb4
# {\bf e} = -e\hat{\bf b}_y.
# ```
# 
# Further, by using Equation {eq}`eqnrb3` in Equation {eq}`eqnrb4`, we can also see that:
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb5
# {\bf e} = -e\hat{\bf a}_y
# ```
# 
# ```{admonition} Terminology
# In the preceding example, $\theta$ is an angle describing the orientation of $B$ relative to $A$ (and vice versa). Thus, it is also called an angular position. Other common ways of referring to it are _orientation angle_ or _attitude angle_.
# ```
# 
# Now, we come to a more involved example, where we will express ${\bf v}$ in terms of the unit vectors of the $A$ frame (using the first of the equations {eq}`eqn1` as the starting point for this discussion):
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb6
# {\bf v} = v\hat{\bf b}_x
# ```
# 
# We can now examine the relationships between the unit vectors by drawing only the unit vectors with the vector $\hat{\bf n}$ out of the plane (see figure below this passage). 
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/21.png
# ---
# name: 21
# ---
# ```
# 
# We can then derive the following relationships by examining the lower figure,  comprising only unit vectors:
# 
# <!--
# ```{figure} ./images/20.png
# ---
# name: 20
# ---
# ```-->
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb7
# \hat{\bf b}_x& = \cos\theta\hat{\bf a}_x + \cos(90 - \theta) \hat{\bf a}_z\\
# \hat{\bf b}_z& = \cos(90 + \theta)\hat{\bf a}_x + \cos(\theta) \hat{\bf a}_z,\\
# ```
# 
# which can also be written as:
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb8
# 
# \hat{\bf b}_x& = \cos\theta\hat{\bf a}_x    + \sin(\theta) \hat{\bf a}_z\\
# \hat{\bf b}_z& = -\sin(\theta)\hat{\bf a}_x + \cos(\theta) \hat{\bf a}_z.\\
# ```
# 
# Then, from the first of {eq}`eqnrb8`:
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb9
# {\bf v} = v(\cos{\theta}\hat{\bf a}_x + \sin{\theta}\hat{\bf a}_z)
# ```
# 
# Along with {eq}`eqnrb3`, we have now established the complete relationship between the unit vectors that make up the $B$ frame in terms of the unit vectors of the $A$ frame. While this is very useful, we can take these relationships one step further and write the equations in matrix form as follows:
# 
# <!--
# ```{figure} ./images/22.png
# ---
# name: 22
# ---
# ```-->
# 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb11
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \hat{\bf b}_x\\
# \hat{\bf b}_y\\
# \hat{\bf b}_z\\
# \end{bmatrix} =
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \cos{\theta} & 0 & \sin\theta \\
# 0 & 1 & 0 \\
# -\sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta \\
# \end{bmatrix}
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \hat{\bf a}_x\\
# \hat{\bf a}_y\\
# \hat{\bf a}_z\\
# \end{bmatrix}
# 
# ```
# 
# Bringing our attention to the second row of the above equation tells us that:
# ```{math}
# :label: eqnrb12
# \hat{\bf b}_y=\hat{\bf a}_y.
# ```
# Visually, this can be interpreted to mean that the door B swings relative to the wall $A$ about the $\hat{\bf b}_y$-axis, which also coincides with the $\hat{\bf a}_y$-axis. In other words, this represents what is known as a simple rotation about the $y$-axis. Similar relationships can also be derived for simple rotations about $x$-axis or $z$-axis.
