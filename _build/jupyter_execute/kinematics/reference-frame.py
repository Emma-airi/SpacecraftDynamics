# * The figure above shows a reference frame $A$ (in pink) and vector ${\bf v}$ (in black).
# * Here, ${\bf v}$ is said to be fixed in the frame $A$ __if and only if__ none of the characteristics of $\bf v$ (i.e., magnitude and direction) are seen to change when it is observed from $A$.

# 
# Below, we make use of some hand illustrations to exemplify the above concept.

# The above handwritten equation can be written in typeface as: 
# ```{math}
# :label: eqn1
# {\bf v}& = v \hat{\bf b}_x\\
# {\bf e}& = -e \hat{\bf b}_y
# ```
# where $v$ and $e$ are the magnitudes of ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf e}$.
# 
# Notice that we have introduced the unit vectors $\hat{\bf b}_x$ and $\hat{\bf b}_y$ for the reference frame $B$ but $\hat{\bf b}_z$ is not shown; however, it still does exist and is orthogonal to both $\hat{\bf b}_x$ and $\hat{\bf b}_y$. For the sake of the next discussions on how reference frames relate to each other, we now also introduce a right-handed set of unit vectors for frame $ A: \: \hat{\bf a}_x,\;\hat{\bf a}_y\:\&\:\hat{\bf a}_z$. We will work with this example in our next Jupyter Notebook, which is our first Practice Activity specifically pertinent to our discussion on dynamics.
