# # Problem 1: Angular Momentum of a Particle
# 
# <img src="Figures/Problem1.png" height=300 width=300>
# 
# A small sphere has the position and velocity indicated in the figure and is acted upon by the force $\bf F$; you may ignore this force for now as we will revisit this example in the following week.
# 
# Determine the angular momentum of the particle about point O.
# 
# You may makes use of all the tools you have learned so far in SymPy to complete your work.

# # Solution
